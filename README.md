- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @zabackermit
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in python, AI, chemistry
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning machine learning for chemists
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on python programming, machine learning and chemistry projects


I am self-taught programmer who became very good in simulation, machine learning, software development from the scratch, data acquisition and analysis, using software tools, and engineering calculations. I have self developed skills needed for machine learning, neural networks, modelling, web scraping, and data acquisition and processing. I am constantly seeking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in this rapidly evolving field. With over than 19 years of chemical industry experience on various positions, I have built multidimensional and multidisciplinary practical knowledge, developed communication skills, versatility, teamwork, eye for a detail and ability to solve problems in the fly ‚Äì unique skills not available to most of other candidates.

What sets me apart as a candidate is my true passion for leveraging machine learning, neural networks and programming to solve real world problems and to make world and people's everyday life better and easier. My skills are self developed with passion, through hard work, experience, critical thinking and problem solving using programming, mathematical and engineering books and cannot be learned in school.
- I have written many computer programs that are used every day at Military Technical Institute, from thermodynamic and chemistry calculations and simulations to test data processing. Those tools increased efficiency, research speed and improved data-driven decision making,
- I am usually making software to help others, so it has to be straight forward, logical, simple, fast and easy to use, but also powerful tool focusing on accurate solution for people without extensive computer knowledge,
- Self-taught in acquisition ligands for specific target using ChEMBL database‚Äôs Python client, calculating their descriptors and fingerprints using rdkit and datamol, clustering based on their fingerprints using rdkit and kmeans, and properties predictions using Random Forest, SVM, neural networks and deepchem ML models,
- Valuable experience and knowledge in NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, tkinter, sqlalchemy, CV2, scikit-learn, rdkit, Keras, and TensorFlow Python libraries, algorithms, design patterns and data structures,
- Self-taught in data preprocessing and cleaning, regression techniques, curve fitting, clustering, modelling, and machine learning, including using CNNs and recurrent neural networks,
- As Researcher and Engineer, I am always seeking for solution, improvements and further development,
- And I still enjoy learning, researching, programming, and self-improvement.
    
My unique work history gives me extraordinary experience and unusual perspective during problem solving, which may be beneficial for developing applications, machine learning tasks and programming. Even without formal education as programmer, I have solid background and readiness to quickly adopt new knowledge and technologies.
